# ~ Step 1: Identify the character within the sentence.
# ~ Step 2: Find that characterâ€™s location within the alphabet.
# ~ Step 3: Identify that characters location + the key in the alphabet.
# ~ Note* if the location + key > 26, loop back around and begin counting at one.
# ~ Step 4: Build a new sentence using the new characters in place of the original characters.
# ~ Step 5: repeat until sentence length is reached. (For loop).
# ~ Step 6: return result.

# ~ create map of letters to numbers
# ~ get characeter from sentence
# ~ Find the character's number
# ~ add character's location number + key Code what to do if 26 is reached: take the greater number and subtract 26 until it is less than 26
# ~ build a new sentence using the new characters (we could print a char array in a loop
# ~ print result
